# GRU

Members: Vaughn Kottler, Paul Kurians

## Technologies

1. **Angular JS 1.5.6**

   Implementation is decent but could be a lot better. Routing and sharing scope is a challenge.

2. **Node.js 4.2.6**
  * Express, mysql, body-parser

   If Node is not already running the frontend won't be able to render anything.

3. **Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (Prod. Env.)**

   Really awesome OS, would recommend running with Gnome Desktop. Much better than CentOS/RHEL for general purposes.

4. **MySQL**

   Highly popular free relational DBMS. MqSQL Workbench extremely useful for working on schemas.

5. **NGINX**

   Set up to redirect traffic on port 80 to port 8080 where Node is listening. NGINX doesn't do anything else.

## Development

Currently it is not possible to work on this application locally. This is because the machine running the database  
is not liking remote connections. This can be fixed but for now don't try to pull and render the UI. If you want to   
see GRU contact Vaughn Kottler, it lives at vaughnsplayground.me when Node is running but I haven't decided to keep   
it up yet. Also contact him if you would like to be a part of the team.
