	<p>   At State Farm we have a problem. We have an exceptional base of knowledable and skilled employees.
    This secure and interal platform will allow the company to Hive Mind questions with new and experienced employees alike.
    Questions are grouped into different 'Farms' by department with a searchable index for locating previously asked questions quickly.
    Currently our talent is forced to search accross multiple inferior applications, creating a potential loss of productivity finding help.
    The Barn would enable us to fluidly communicate with each other in a streamlined and uniform platform.  At State Farm we are a family.
    This platform will allow us to create an unparalleled way for our employees to solve problems and ask questions in a fun and interactive way. </p>

  <p>	State Farm's vision for the future is to be the customers first and best choice in the products and services we provide.
    Our success is built on a foundation of shared value. Re3markable (RE3â„¢) describes our culture of serving others.
    It's about how we interact with our customers and how State Farm agents and associates interact with each other in support of our customers.
    We created our platform with all this in mind to create the best possible customer outcome starting with us, The State Farm family. </p>
